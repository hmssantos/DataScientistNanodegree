In the age of technology, with information being processed all the time, word processing has become something, in addition to being extremely important, necessary.
In Brazil, the challenge is doubled. Much of the evolution that occurs in NLP does not apply directly to the country, since the Portuguese language has a very different complexity and nature from English (which, in general, is the promoter of important advances).
In this project, I develop an application capable of extracting comments from YouTube videos referring to a certain subject, to then process and present them, in a summarized way, in a dashboard, which helps in understanding that context.

## Problem Definition
Today, a huge amount of users interact with videos that are posted on YouTube with likes, shares or even comments. It turns out that reaching some conclusion that generates value based on these interactions is something extremely difficult. In addition to the usual quantitative controls, the text element makes the task even more complex. You see, it’s not that the task of dealing with numbers is easy, but it turns out to be much more intuitive to deal with them directly than with texts.
Thinking about this pain (natural language processing), and even more, in the Brazilian public, which has a smaller repertoire of applications and codes dedicated to this purpose, I developed this project.
The idea is to go beyond text analysis alone, in isolation, or very academic. I want to develop a tool that incorporates a whole flow of extraction, treatment, data analysis, statistical modeling, up to the final part, the presentation of outputs through a BI tool. And the main thing is that this entire flow is as automated and intelligent as possible.
As I need to use some example, including to promote specific adjustments in the codes, I will use a real case, which I actually studied. It is the crypto game CryptoCars. If you’re not that familiar with crypto games, I suggest you read it beforehand to put yourself in a better context.

## Project Scope
The objective of this project is to build a flow that starts with the extraction of data from YouTube and ends with the presentation of information synthesized in a BI tool. For that, I need:
• Part 01: Extract and Treat data from YouTube through an API
• Part 02: Process data and Apply Statistical Modeling
• Part 03: Model Evaluation
• Part 04: Store data on Google Cloud Platform
• Part 05: Integrate GCP with Data Studio

## Heads up
For the code to work correctly, it is important that you have access to the YouTube API key, as well as the GCP, to upload the tables.
